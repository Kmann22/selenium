Introduction
- software testing is the process of finding defects in a software.
- the goal is to release quality software to the customer/client.

Manual Testing:
- Performing the testing w/o any tools
- Here a tester/person will do the testing.

Problem with Manual Testing:
- Re-testing: 
. Conduct testing again and again with different types of data
. So time and effort!!
- Regression Testing:
.  Software testing life cycle process.
.  Eg. 10 Testcases==2fail 8pass report to the developer
.  Developer fix the code
.  So dependent functionalities also needs to be tested.

Therefore Automated Testing
- reduce time
- reduce effort

Automation Testing
- Performing the testing with the help of tools(software) is known as Automation Testing.

Test Case
- Step by step process that we need to perform to test.
- Manual testing: Do the testcase, step by step and the expected page is displayed or not.
- Automation testing: (Application under test) convert the manual test into test script. (automation test)

Who can understand the test script?
- Automation tools


Why do we need Programming?
Test case(English) -->  Manual Testing--->Test Script(Language: Java/Python)--->Tool
Therefore we need to know programming

How does Automation tool works?
